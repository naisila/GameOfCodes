# Game of Codes
A project in SystemVerilog given by course instructor in CS223 Fall 2017 Course, Bilkent University.
### Project setup
Check [image1.jpg](https://github.com/NaisilaPuka/Game-of-Codes/blob/master/image1.jpg).
### Framework
VIVADO 2015.2
Vivado Design Suite is a software suite produced by Xilinx for synthesis and analysis of HDL designs, superseding Xilinx ISE with additional features for system on a chip development and high-level synthesis.
### Project description
A sequence of random codes is generated by the hardware inside the FPGA. The stepper motor module on the Beti board plays this sequence by applying unique movements for each code. The player person watches the movements of stepper motor and enters the corresponding ASCII character sequence using the 4x4 keypad on the Beti board. For each correct/incorrect character, the player earns/loses 1 point. Total points are displayed on the 7-segment display module on the BASYS-3 board (use only one of digits).
### Note
I used both the FPGA BASYS-3 board and the Beti board together. BASYS-3 board should be assembled on the Beti board properly using a connector board.
